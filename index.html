<!-- About Me -->
<section>
<h2 style="text-align: center; font-weight: bold">About Me</h2>

<p>
I am a master's student, studying in a Master of Science in Computer Science program at Georgia Tech. I have a wide interest in AI, robotics, computer vision and design.
</p>
 
<p>
Earlier, I earned my Master's Degree in Mechanical Engineering from <a href="https://www.cmu.edu/">Carnegie Mellon University</a> in 2019. I worked as a graduate research assistant on AI for design in <a href="http://vdel.me.cmu.edu/">Visaul Design and Engineering Lab</a> (VDEL). I worked closely with <a href="https://www.meche.engineering.cmu.edu/faculty/kara.html">Prof. Levent Burak Kara</a>, <a href="http://www.me.tsinghua.edu.cn/info/1099/1571.htm">Prof. Zhenguo Nie</a> and <a href="https://www.meche.engineering.cmu.edu/directory/bios/barati-farimani-amir.html">Prof. Amir Barati Farimani</a>. 
</p>

<p>
Prior to my graduate study, I graduated from Shanghai High School and received my Bachelor's degree in Vehicle Engineering from <a href="https://en.tongji.edu.cn/">Tongji University</a> in 2017 . In 2016 summer, I was a visiting research intern in <a href="http://firebrand.me.berkeley.edu/">Combustion Modeling Lab</a>, <a href="https://www.berkeley.edu/">U.C.Berkeley</a> working with <a href="https://www.me.berkeley.edu/people/faculty/jyh-yuan-chen/">Prof. Jyh-Yuan Chen</a>.
</p>
    
<p>
    Other than that, I have also enjoyed my time at <a href="https://illinois.edu/">University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign</a> and at <a href="https://www.ucla.edu/">University of California at Los Angeles</a> during undergraduate exchanging programs.

<p>
f : i 've never expected to meet you in a park .
</p>
f : i 'm sorry i have to buy some groceries around the corner . see you later !

train_6476
m : me too . it looks really nice .
m : i like the style of it a lot too . the 2 pieces match perfectly .
m : to be honest , the shoes do n't go well with your dress .
train_6804
m : so , you 've not thought of getting a taxi ? okay , i will pick you up .
m : so , you think your original idea is not the best and you will take a taxi ?
m : so , as then there 's no the traffic to worry about , you will go home by train ?
train_3328
f : you should have come soon after you felt uneasy the day before yesterday .
f : as you come one day after you felt the flu , just take pills and keep working .
f : you come four days after your felt the headache , so it becomes a bit serious .
train_809
f : it 's normal . chinese is more difficult . but you are learning very quickly .
f : really . i thought it is more challenging for you to learn english , rather than chinese .
f : do you think french is more difficult than chinese ?
train_5911
f : you can borrow lu xun 's book here .
f : do you want to buy anything else ?
f : will you come to the hospital tomorrow ?
train_5563
f : i 'm surprised that you did n't get the book you needed , because the library closes so late on weekends .
f : yeah , the library is closed on weekends . it only opens from monday to friday .
f : i know . you are too busy to go to the library , although it closes so late on weekends .
train_4484
f : i like both volleyball and basketball .

f : the ring is not good . all that you notice is just the size .
f : you only remember the price ? even so , the gold ring is cheaper .
train_6017
m : you 're absolutely right . too much soap would produce dirt in the clothes .
m : i see . according to you , too much soap would produce few bubbles , so bacteria would then grow .
m : indeed , too much soap would require much more water to clean , though the machines can have them removed completely .
train_2109
m : wow , your mother is so good ! she can teach you flower arrangement and tea ceremony .
m : it 's no wonder you do n't know any kinds of art , because there is no art courses in school .
m : your school life would be boring because school does not offer any art courses .
train_4742
f : will the meeting start at one o'clock ? i will be sleepy then .
f : should i give mr. white a call at one o'clock ? he will have a lunch break at that time .

m : parents also worried about bill . you should worry about your work .
m : honey , doctor says he 'll have to stay in bed until tuesday .
train_4793

m : you should take the first pair . the color red matches you the best .
train_5215
f : you also think so , right ? it 's alway sunny days in autumn .
f : you mean the weather report says it will be cold and rainy this autumn ? oh , no .
f : indeed , autumn ca n't always be beautiful . last year 's autumn was terrible .
train_6300
m : the doctor 's office sent you an email last month , and maybe you need to come to the clinic once a year .
m : you come to the clinic every two years . no wonder you 've registered when you were in the clinic today .
m : you are so beautiful that everyone remembers you , even if you come to the clinic every four years .
train_2727
m : you are right . i should figure out the problem of the calculator by myself . i 'm good at it .
m : i 'm going to call the repair store as you suggest . the buttons of my calculator do n't work at all , but i will soon need it .
m : i think so . i will borrow the tools to fix the calculator . i know what 's the problem .
train_7079
m : this is the best piano we have and it costs only $ 1500 . it should be the best choice for your son .

f : so , you ended up teaching spanish there and you went to south america to learn about local life ?
train_193
f : yeah , that round bottle over there is very big . but since we are in the market , we can buy a new one .
f : yes . the fish can get enough air in a small round bottle . i think we can put a small battle in this office .
